What is programing language?
A.
Programming language is a set of instructions, syntaxes and rules used to create software applications.
They are mostly high level languages that can be understood by human to develop the logic and then translated
by compilers and interpreters to machine language. ex: Java.

A.
Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans.

A.
Coding(writing the program), Compiling(java compiler) tob bytecode, jvm(translate byte code to machine code.
and jre for running the program.

what is class?
A.
A class in java is a blue print for java object. In other words it is structure from which many
objects can be created. It holds the most common fields and attributes.

What is object?

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?

Interface is a contract that hold methods declaration without implementation. They are used when
 we know the requirements but not the implementation.
 Abstract class in the other hand is used when we know partial implementation but not all.

Inheritance : It is a mechanism in which one class inherit feature from another class.
Polymorphism : Polymorphism means many forms. It is a concept by which we can perform
a single action in different ways. Two types of polymorphism: Overloading(early/static binding )
and Overriding(dynamic/late binding).
Encapsulation :It is a way of wrapping code and data to gother in a single unit. we may use p0rivate
variables and use getters and setters to access them.

Method overloading is the mechanism of having methods with same name but different set of
parameters either parameters types, number, oir order must be different. It happen at compile
