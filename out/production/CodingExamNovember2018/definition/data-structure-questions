Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.
Data structure is a way to organize data in such way that optimize it search and retrieval.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A.
Insertion
Deletion
Searching
Sorting

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A.
 Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical analysis package,

 Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Simulation

what is an Array?
A.
Array is a fixed size object of homogeneous data type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A.
Array is fixed size while ArrayList is dynamic. Array hold primitive data types
while ArrayList holds object/reference data types.


what is LinkedList?
A.
Linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by
their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It
is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.


How is an Array different from Linked List?
A.
Array elements are indexed and Linked List nodes hold the address of next element(node).


what is queue?
A.
Queue is a data structure which use First In First Out(FIFO).

what is stack?
A.
Stack is a data structure that use Last In First Out(LIFO).

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A.
FIFO-First In First Out.
LIFO- Last In First Out.

what is the order of complexity?
A.
Analysis the speed of the program ruin based on complexity of algorithm.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A.
when the array is sorted.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A.
when the array is not sorted.

what is tree in data structure?
A.
A tree is nonlinear data structure that consists of zer or more nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
A.
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes
also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the
 graph.  Graphs are used to represent networks.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A.
HashTable is synchronized, HashMap is not.
HashTable doesn't doesn't allow null, HashMap does.



What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A.
RDBMS – Array (i.e. Array of structures)

Network data model – Graph

Hierarchical data model – Trees

How HashMap works in java?
A.
HashMap in Java works on hashing principle. It is a data structure which allows us to store
 object and retrieve it in constant time O(1) provided we know the key. In hashing, hash
 functions are used to link key and value in HashMap. Objects are stored by calling put(key,
 value) method of HashMap and retrieved by calling get(key) method. When we call put method,
 hashcode() method of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a
 bucket location to store value object, which is actually an index of the internal array


What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A.
It is  a run time Exception that occurs when the programn try to access an index that out of the
array boundary.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A.
Manually using loops.
Arrays.copyOf()
System.arraycopy()
Object.clone()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A.
Arrays are index based data structure where each element associated with an index.
On the other hand, Linked list relies on references where each node consists of the
data and the references to the previous and next element.


What is DFS and BFS?
A.
Breadth First Search(BFS):
Depth First Search(DFS):

What is Recursion?
A.
Recursion is method calls itself.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A.
 linear data structure arranges the data into a sequence and follow some sort of order.
 Whereas, the non-linear data structure does not organize the data in a sequential manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. It is used to describe the performance or complexity of algorithm. It gives execution time

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A.

The choice of the best sorting algorithm depends on the context.For large inputs,
 Mergesort, Heapsort and Quicksortare the best algorithms with worst case running time of Mergesort and
 Heapsort, and the average case running time of Quicksort being O(nlogn).(The worst case of
 Quicksort which has a running time of O(n^2) ...

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
